# industrial-anomaly-detection 🚧

A machine learning project to detect anomalies in industrial sensor data using supervised learning.

# 🏭 Industrial Anomaly Detection using Machine Learning

## 🎯 Objective
Build a machine learning model to detect anomalies in industrial sensor data and improve equipment reliability by predicting failures.

## 📂 Dataset
Synthetic data simulating equipment sensor readings.
- Features: `Temperature`, `Location`, `Anomaly`
- Categorical encoded: `Location`
- Target: `Anomaly` (0 - Normal, 1 - Anomaly)

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, SMOTE
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- GitHub, GitHub Desktop

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
- Data cleaning and feature encoding
- Addressed class imbalance using SMOTE
- Trained multiple models (Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
- Evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC

## ✅ Best Results
- Random Forest: 99.9% Accuracy, ROC-AUC: 0.9997

## 💾 How to Run
